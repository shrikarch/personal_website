        <p>
          Created a ticketing system based on Elixir (programming language) and Phoenix (framework) that supported multi-user interface. The multiple users were handled by taking advantage of processes in Elixir. (Process for each user). <br>
          Keeping the distributed deployment in mind the application was made fail proof using supervisors and would route the ticket to the least busy representative.

          <p>
            Created Random Geometric Graphs on a unit plane/disc using Python's NetworkX library.
            Then a largest possible subgraph was selected out of the generated network graph.
            Smallest Last graph coloring algorithm was used next to find two longest continuous bipartite graphs - Longest backbones.
            <br>
            The objective of this project was to simulate the optimum path of connectivity for a bunch of sensorts, randomly present in a planar environment.

          <p>
            A small scale project made within 24 hours at HackDFW that earned us an opportunity to enter an accelerator program for start-ups. <br>
            The whole mirror was made from merely a few things: Used cereal boxes, a wood frame, an acrylic sheet with reflective coating, an LED monitor and a Raspberry Pie! <br>
            The interface was designed in HTML5 and was based on meteor.js with multiple APIs used to serve the data like live stocks, emails, tweets and weather and was controlled by voice. <br>
            JavaScript library 'annyang!' was used for voice recognition.

            As a part of a class based on Operating System, this project was created to simulate and show memory allocation, memory management and process scheduling in Operating Systems. While the preferred choice of language for majority students in the class was Java or C++, I decided to do it in JavaScript based on NodeJs.

            -The Project was done using R in RStudio. <br>
            -Using the data sets we have to help increase U.S. high school graduation rate from 81.4% in 2013 to 90% by the year 2020 <br>
            -The major challenges were understanding the given data, cleaning the data, visualization of the data and finding the relationships between different variables of the data. <br>
            -Different Classification models like CART, random forest, conditional inference tree, C4.5 algorithm, linear support vector machines were applied to the dataset.After creating classification models, it was assessed by various techniques like bootstrap validation, cross validation etc. <br>
            -Also studied and implemented the association rules between two different data sets. <br>
            -In addition to that, clustering analysis using different methods like k-means, hierarchical clustering, dbscan clustering was performed on the set. <br>
